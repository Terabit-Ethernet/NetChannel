# NetChannel: Disaggregating the Host Network Stack
NetChannel is a new disaggregated network stack architecture that enables resources allocated to each layer in the packet processing pipeline to be scaled and scheduled independently. Evaluation of an end-to-end realization of NetChannel within the Linux network stack demonstrates that NetChannel enables new operating points that were previously unachievable:
- Independent scaling of data copy processing allows a single application thread to saturate 100Gbps access link bandwidth.
- Independent scaling of network connections allows short flows to increase throughput almost linearly with cores.
- Dynamic scheduling of packets between application threads and network connections at fine-grained timescales allows latency-sensitive applications to achieve Âµs-scale tail latency, even when competing with bandwidth-intensive applications operating at near-line rate.

## 1. Overview
### Repository overview

## 2. Build NetChannel
NetChannel has been successfully tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Linux kernel 5.6. Building the NetChannel kernel and kernel modules should be done on _both Client and Server machines_.

### Install Prerequisites
We need to install prerequisites to compile the kernel. On Ubuntu 20.04, this can be done with
   ```
   sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev gawk flex bison openssl libssl-dev dkms dwarves  \
                     libelf-dev libudev-dev libpci-dev libiberty-dev autoconf sysstat
   ```

### NetChannel Kernel
1. Download Linux kernel source tree:  
   ```
   cd ~
   wget https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.6.tar.gz
   tar xzvf linux-5.6.tar.gz
   ```

2. Download and apply the NetChannel kernel patch to the kernel source:  

   ```
   git clone -b new_flow_control https://github.com/Terabit-Ethernet/NetChannel.git
   cd ~/linux-5.6/
   git apply ../NetChannel/kernel_patch/netchannel-kernel.patch
   ```

3. Update kernel configuration (with root):  

   ```
   sudo -s
   cp /boot/config-`uname -r` ./.config
   make olddefconfig
   scripts/config --set-str SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS ""
   ```

4. Compile and install:  

   ```
   make -j32 bzImage
   make -j32 modules
   make modules_install
   make install
   ```
   The number 32 means the number of threads created for compilation. Set it to be the total number of cores of your system to reduce the compilation time. Type `lscpu | grep 'CPU(s)'` to see the total number of cores:
   
   ```
   CPU(s):                32
   On-line CPU(s) list:   0-31
   ```

5. Edit `/etc/default/grub` to boot with your new kernel by default. For example:  

   ```
   GRUB_DEFAULT="1>Ubuntu, with Linux 5.6.0-netchannel"
   ```

6. Update the grub configuration and reboot into the new kernel.  

   ```
   update-grub && reboot
   ```
   
7. When system is rebooted, check the kernel version, type `uname -r` in the command-line. It should be `5.6.0-netchannel`.  
   
### NetChannel Kernel Modules
1. Go to the kernel module directory:  

   ```
   cd ~/NetChannel/module/
   ```
   
2. Edit `nd_plumbing.c` (line 281) to change the local IP, remote IP address and the number of remote hosts:  

   ```
   params->local_ip = "192.168.10.116";

   /* set the number of remote hosts */
   params->num_remote_hosts = 2;
   params->remote_ips[0] = "192.168.10.116";
   params->remote_ips[1] = "192.168.10.117";
   ```

   **[NOTE]** Use `params->local_ip = "192.168.10.117"` on the Server-side.  
   
  
3. Compile and load the NetChannel kernel module:  

   ```
   make
   sudo insmod nd_module.ko
   ```

### NetChannel Applications  
1. Build io_uring library (liburing):  

   ```
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/axboe/liburing
   cd liburing
   make
   cd ~/NetChannel/util/
   ```

2. Edit `Makefile` to set the liburing-path (line 1):  

   ```
   liburing-path = /home/(account name)/liburing
   ```

3. Edit `netdriver_test.cc` to change the host IP adddress (line 758):  

   ```
   addr_in.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("192.168.10.116");
   ```

   **[NOTE]** Use `inet_addr("192.168.10.117")` on the Server-side.

4. Compile the applications:  

   ```
   make
   ```

5. Add IPPROTO_VIRTUAL_SOCK in netinet/in.h:  

   We need to define **IPPROTO_VIRTUAL_SOCK** for NetChannel applications. Add the two lines in `/usr/include/netinet/in.h` (line 58):

   ```
   ...
      IPPROTO_VIRTUAL_SOCK = 19,      /* Virtual Socket.  */
   #define IPPROTO_VIRTUAL_SOCK     IPPROTO_VIRTUAL_SOCK
   ...
   ```

## 3. Run a Toy Experiment  
**[NOTE]** You should confirm that NetChannel kernel module is loaded in both machines before activating the NetChannel module.

1. On both sides:  

   Load the NetChannel kernel module and run network configuration scripts:

   ```
   sudo insmod ~/NetChannel/module/nd_module.ko
   sudo ~/NetChannel/scripts/network_setup.sh ens2f0
   sudo ~/NetChannel/scripts/enable_arfs.sh ens2f0
   ```

2. On the Server side:  

   Activate the NetChannel kernel module and run a test server application with the Server IP address (e.g., 192.168.10.117):
   ```
   sudo ~/NetChannel/scripts/run_module.sh
   cd ~/NetChannel/util/
   ./run_single_server.sh 192.168.10.117 1
   ```

3. On the Client side:  

   Activate the NetChannel kernel module and run a test client application with the Server IP address (e.g., 192.168.10.117):
   ```
   sudo ~/NetChannel/scripts/run_module.sh
   cd ~/NetChannel/util/
   ./run_client.sh 192.168.10.117 1 nd
   ```

Type `sudo killall server` on the Server machine to stop the server application.
   
 
## SIGCOMM 2022 Artifact Evaluation
### Hardware/Software Configuration
We have used the follwing hardware and software configurations for running the experiments shown in the paper.

* CPU: 4-Socket Intel Xeon Gold 6234 3.3 GHz with 8 cores per socket (with hyperthreading disabled)
* RAM: 384 GB
* NIC: Mellanox ConnectX-5 Ex VPI (100 Gbps)
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 with Linux 5.6 (patched)

#### Caveats of Our Work
Our work has been evaluated with two servers with 4-socket multi-core CPUs and 100 Gbps NICs directly connected with a DAC cable. While we generally focus on trends rather than individual data points, other combinations of end-host network stacks and hardware may exhibit different performance characteristics. All our scripts use `network_setup.sh` to configure the NIC to allow a specific benchmark to be performed. Some of these configurations may be specific to Mellanox NICs (e.g., enabling aRFS).

### NetChannel Configurations
On both sides:

1. Load NetChannel module:  
   ```
   sudo insmod ~/NetChannel/module/nd_module.ko
   sudo ~/NetChannel/scripts/network_setup.sh ens2f0
   sudo ~/NetChannel/scripts/enable_arfs.sh ens2f0
   ```
   
   **[NOTE] Step 1 should be done on both sides before Step 2.**

2. Activate NetChannel module:  
   ```
   sudo ~/NetChannel/scripts/run_module.sh
   cd ~/NetChannel/sigcomm22_artifact/
   ```
   
3. Edit `param.sh` to change the IP addresses and interface name:
   ```
   client_ip=192.168.10.116
   server_ip=192.168.10.117
   iface=ens2f0
   ```
   
4. (**Skip if configured**) Configure `sysstat` and `ssh`:

   We use `sar/sysstat` and `ssh` to measure CPU utilization in the artifact evaluation scripts. Please refer to [Installing sar/sysstat](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-install-and-configure-sar-sysstat-on-ubuntu) (both sides) and [SSH login without password](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/11/3-steps-to-perform-ssh-login-without-password-using-ssh-keygen-ssh-copy-id/) (Client-side only). Once the configrations are done correctly, you should be able to measure Server-side CPU utilization via the following command:
   
   Client: `ssh 192.168.10.117 'sar -u 3 1'`
   ```
   Linux 5.6.0-netchannel (xxxx)         xx/xx/2022      _x86_64_        (32 CPU)

   10:48:53 AM     CPU     %user     %nice   %system   %iowait    %steal     %idle
   10:48:58 AM     all      0.01      0.00      0.03      0.00      0.00     99.96
   Average:        all      0.01      0.00      0.03      0.00      0.00     99.96
   ```
